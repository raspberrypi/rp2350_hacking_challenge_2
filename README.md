# RP2350 Hacking Challenge 2 - Here we go again...

Welcome to the *second* Raspberry Pi RP2350 hacking challenge!

Watch our quick explainer video:

Our first [Hacking Challenge](https://github.com/raspberrypi/rp2350_hacking_challenge) back in 2024 was both enlightening and enjoyable for us, and garnered positive feedback from the participants and onlookers, so we decided to do it once more 🙃

This second Hacking Challenge focuses on side-channel analysis of the encrypted boot of the RP2350, using our newly developed self-decrypting (AES) binary support.

This new support was developed to allow customers to encrypt their application code and data when stored in external flash, and have these loaded into internal SRAM, where our AES software library will decrypt the application in place, using key material and salt squirreled away in the OTP.

We’re looking for challenge participants to use any form of side-channel analysis (Power, EM, timing. Etc) to leak AES key material in a way that will reduce the effective key length to a point where the decryption of the payload is viable.

We have employed various *devious* individuals to add forms of “hardening” to this AES implementation, so we hope it’ll stand up to a high level of analysis and meddling.

We challenge you to prove us wrong! (again)

Unlike the first challenge, we're running this one as a "first across the line" competition, with a single winner (or winning team).  
- It'll run for 3 months (We may choose to extend this if required)  
- The prize will be $20,000 USD  


## Things in scope:
- Any and all forms of side-channel analysis
- Any version of RP2350 or RP2354 (Die version A2/A3 or A4)  
(Feel free to email us at [doh@raspberrypi.com](mailto:doh@raspberrypi.com) with ideas or questions on what could be in scope)
	
## Out of scope:
- Optical / PVC / SEM attacks on the OTP contents or control logic (You know who you are :-P )
- Modifying our AES implementation in a way that weakens it
- Using any of the known glitching bugs reported in A2 / A3 silicon to access OTP contents

## How to report findings
If you think you're onto something that looks promising, we'd like to hear from you early.
We'll be looking for you to be able to articulate your findings and any hypotheses you may have, but don't feel like you have to write a dissertation before you get in touch!  
Please email us via [doh@raspberrypi.com](mailto:doh@raspberrypi.com)

## Example code

In this repository you can find a full, already instrumentalized example of our AES implementation:

- aes.S contains the implementation that you can also find in [Picotool](https://github.com/raspberrypi/picotool/blob/develop/enc_bootloader/aes.S) - with some minor patches to make it run from regular flash
- rp2350_hacking_challenge_2.c contains a small example program that calls into the AES implementation and already provides a trigger for your initial SCA needs
- If you want to trigger somewhere within the assembly, you can simply add "bl trigger" into the assembly


**Note:**: The implementation shared in the example code has some fault-injection hardening checks removed and is mainly for making side-channel measurements easier. Attacks should work against the code as used by the bootloader.

## Keytool

The AES implementation splits the AES key into a 4-way split. To make this easier to work with you can also find `keytool.py` in this repository.

Using `keytool.py` you can split an existing AES key into a 4-way key:

```
$ python3 ./keytool.py encode 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

```

If you need a C-array, you can add the "-c" option:

```
$ python3 ./keytool.py -c encode 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

```

## Instructions

To build the project, follow these instructions:

```
mkdir build && cd build
cmake -DPICO_PLATFORM=rp2350 -DPICO_BOARD=pico2 ..
make
```

This will generate a rp2350_hacking_challenge_2.uf2, that you can then copy to your RP2350 board.

Usage of the example program is easy, it supports two commands:

- `K` followed by 128 bytes of 4-way key-data (as created by keytool.py) sets the encryption key. The default-key is all 0.
- `E` executes an encryption and then prints out the result as hex.
